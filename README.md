NFT Image scrambler

This can either be ran from the python file: image_scrambler.py or from the executable in the dist folder.

Make sure input folder follows this structure:

```
input   
│
└───accessories
└───background
└───base
└───eyes
└───hair
```

This is important as the order in which the layers are glued together is important!
